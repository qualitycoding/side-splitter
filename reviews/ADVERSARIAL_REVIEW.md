# Adversarial review record — v3.9 addendum

**Repository:** `qualitycoding/side-splitter`.

Adversarial questions applied to the amendment diff (substitution per D-906 —
same-author adversarial pass; fresh-context reviewer unavailable):

1. Does the gap ledger match the addendum exactly? Yes — `plan/ADDENDUM-V3.9-GAP.md`.
2. Any product behaviour change? None — D-900; the diff touches planning artifacts only.
3. Any swallowed failure or unrun check reported green? None locally; CI-dependent checks are recorded as pending-in-CI (D-905).
4. Secret exposure? No credentials recorded in any artifact; the write token was used from the environment only.
5. Frozen manifest changed? No — re-freeze not required; no frozen artifact legitimately changed.

Unresolved items: none at planning level. Residual risk: no independent
fresh-context adversarial pass (High, recorded).
